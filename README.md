# Playing with Matplotlib

Just a small repo to store some tests with Matplotlib from dataquest's [blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots).


## os_gotcha.py

So this is tiny script and more of a reminder to self that Atom uses the top most project folder as the working directory. This WILL mangle all relative paths.

## percent_bachelors.csv

The demo uses a direct link to the dataset but rather use a downloaded dataset for something that isn't going to change as it isn't me paying for the bandwidth.

Thank you to Randal Olson for the dataset and his blog post with his visualisations is [here](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/).

A direct link to the dataset if you want to directly download the csv is [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv).
